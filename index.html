      The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
      association football competition contested by the senior men's national
      teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football
      Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.<br />
      The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural
      tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because
      of the Second World War.<br />
      The current champions are France, who won their second title at the 2018
      tournament in Russia. Host selection criticism Russian President Vladimir
      Putin handing over the symbolic relay baton for the hosting rights of the
      2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in June 2018
      There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection
      process involving FIFA's executive committee members. These allegations
      are being investigated by FIFA (see § Bidding corruption allegations,
      2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA
      senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup
      2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption have been made
      relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal
      investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief
      investigator Michael J. Garcia has since described FIFA's report on his
      enquiry as containing "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous
      representations. In May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an
      investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and
      2022 World Cup bids. In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter
      claimed that Qatar had used "black ops", suggesting that the bid committee
      had cheated to win the hosting rights. Some investigations found that
      Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer
      turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and
      key football officials who picked the winner in 2010. In September 2018, a
      delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to
      reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government
      restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and
      returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport
      facilities.Qatar has faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign
      workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty
      International referring to "forced labour" and poor working conditions,
      while many migrant workers reported having to pay large "recruitment fees"
      to obtain employment. The Guardian newspaper reported that many workers
      are denied food and water, have their identity papers taken away from
      them, and that they are not paid on time or at all, making some of them in
      effect slaves. The Guardian has estimated that up to 4,000 workers may die
      from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition is held.
      Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to
      improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and
      the removal of the kafala system. According to Amnesty International,
      however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers have not
      improved in the last years. Qatar is the smallest nation by area ever to
      have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area is
      Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which is more than three times as
      large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also
      became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of
      the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having
      never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting
      rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the
      finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight
      stadiums used in the tournament, six are located in the Doha metropolitan
      area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the
      stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and
      players needed to commute, Qatar itself is struggling to accommodate the
      numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space. Due to
      Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers have announced
      the creation of designated "sobering up" zones as an alternative to
      wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup. Qatar's World
      Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy,
      Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up
      areas was to ensure the fans' safety. If a fan is sent to the "sobering
      up" zone, they will be permitted to leave when they can display
      clearheaded behavior. Multiple news agencies described the controversy as
      a "cultural clash" between social conservatism and Islamic morality
      against the "norms" of secular Western liberal democracies.
